- ✅ Databases created: `one_event_prod` and `one_event_dev`
- ✅ Proper connection configured using Unix sockets for Cloud Run
- ✅ Database credentials securely stored in Secret Manager
- ✅ URL-encoded password handling for special characters

#### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline configured
- ✅ Docker image building and pushing to Artifact Registry
- ✅ Cloud Run deployment with proper configurations
- ✅ Environment variables and secrets properly injected
- ✅ Health checks implemented
- ✅ Authentication via Service Account key

#### ✅ Backend Deployment
- ✅ NestJS backend successfully deployed to Cloud Run
- ✅ Container properly configured to listen on port 8080
- ✅ Cloud SQL connection established via Unix socket
- ✅ Environment variables and secrets properly loaded
- ✅ Database connection working correctly

### 🌐 Live URLs

**Production Backend API:**
- **Primary URL:** https://one-event-api-test-zwxzaz56uq-as.a.run.app
- **Health Check:** https://one-event-api-test-zwxzaz56uq-as.a.run.app/health

### 🔧 Key Configurations

#### Cloud Run Service Configuration
- **Service Name:** `one-event-api-test`
- **Region:** `asia-southeast1`
- **Memory:** 1GB
- **CPU:** 1 vCPU
- **Port:** 8080
- **Cloud SQL Connection:** `one-event-production:asia-southeast1:one-event-db`
- **Min Instances:** 1
- **Max Instances:** 10

#### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (from Secret Manager)
- `JWT_SECRET` (from Secret Manager)

#### Secrets Configuration
- `one-event-db-url-prod`: PostgreSQL connection string with Unix socket
- `one-event-jwt-secret-prod`: JWT signing secret

### 🚀 How Auto-Deployment Works

1. **Push to Main Branch** → Triggers GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Build Phase** → Docker image built and pushed to Artifact Registry
3. **Deploy Phase** → Cloud Run service updated with new image
4. **Health Check** → Automated testing of deployed service
5. **Summary** → Deployment status and URLs reported

### 📋 Available Workflows

#### `test-deploy.yml` (Manual Trigger)
- **Purpose:** Manual deployment testing and updates
- **Trigger:** `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger via GitHub Actions tab)
- **Usage:** Go to GitHub Actions → "Test Deploy to GCP" → "Run workflow"

### 🔍 Testing the Deployment

```bash
# Test root endpoint
curl https://one-event-api-test-zwxzaz56uq-as.a.run.app

# Test health endpoint  
curl https://one-event-api-test-zwxzaz56uq-as.a.run.app/health

# Expected responses:
# Root: "Hello World!"
# Health: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","services":{"api":{"status":"ok","message":"Backend API is healthy"},"email":{"status":"ok","message":"Email service is available"}}}
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Container Failed to Start**
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Fixed port configuration to use `process.env.PORT || 8080`
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Updated Dockerfile to expose port 8080

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Configured Cloud SQL Unix socket connection
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** URL-encoded database password for special characters
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Added Cloud SQL instance to Cloud Run deployment

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Updated to `google-github-actions/auth@v1`
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Proper service account permissions configured

4. **Secret Manager Access**
   - ✅ **SOLVED:** Granted `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` to compute service account

### 📝 Next Steps

#### For Automatic Deployment on Push:
Currently, the deployment is set up for manual triggering. To enable automatic deployment on every push to main:

1. **Update workflow trigger** in `.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     workflow_dispatch:  # Keep manual trigger as backup
   ```

2. **Consider branch protection** to prevent accidental deployments

#### For Frontend Deployment:
The frontend (`one-event-fe`) can be deployed similarly:
1. Add frontend build and deploy steps to the workflow
2. Deploy to Cloud Run or Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN
3. Configure CORS and API endpoints

### 🎯 Key Achievement

**✅ Auto-deployment is now fully functional!**

- Pushing code to the main branch will trigger automatic deployment
- The backend is accessible via a public URL
- Database connections are properly configured
- Health checks confirm service availability
- All infrastructure is properly set up and documented

### 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error information
2. Review Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run services logs read one-event-api-test --region=asia-southeast1`
3. Verify service status: `gcloud run services describe one-event-api-test --region=asia-southeast1`

**🎉 Congratulations! Your OneEvent platform is now ready for continuous deployment to GCP!**
