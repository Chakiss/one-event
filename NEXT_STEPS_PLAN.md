# OneEvent Platform - Next Steps Plan

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Backend deployed to Cloud Run
- ‚úÖ Auto-deployment via GitHub Actions working
- ‚úÖ Database connected and working
- ‚úÖ Backend API accessible at: https://one-event-api-test-712057384144.asia-southeast1.run.app

## üéØ NEXT PRIORITIES

### **Priority 1: Deploy Frontend**
Deploy the Next.js frontend to make the complete application accessible to users.

**Tasks:**
1. Create Dockerfile for frontend
2. Update GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy frontend
3. Configure frontend to connect to backend API
4. Deploy to Cloud Run
5. Set up custom domain (optional)

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

### **Priority 2: Environment Configuration**
Set up proper environment variables and secrets for different environments.

**Tasks:**
1. Configure production environment variables
2. Set up email service (SMTP/SendGrid)
3. Configure authentication secrets
4. Set up SSL certificates if using custom domain

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes

### **Priority 3: Database Setup & Migration**
Ensure the database schema is properly set up and populated.

**Tasks:**
1. Run database migrations
2. Set up initial data/seed data if needed
3. Configure database backups
4. Test database connectivity from deployed services

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

### **Priority 4: Testing & Monitoring**
Set up comprehensive testing and monitoring for the deployed application.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up health checks for both frontend and backend
2. Configure logging and monitoring (Cloud Logging/Monitoring)
3. Set up alerts for service downtime
4. Perform end-to-end testing of deployed application

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

### **Priority 5: Security & Performance**
Optimize and secure the deployed application.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up HTTPS/SSL certificates
2. Configure CORS properly
3. Set up rate limiting
4. Optimize performance (CDN, caching)
5. Security scanning and hardening

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Priority 1 (Frontend Deployment)** because:
- Backend is already working perfectly
- Users need the frontend to interact with the application
- It's the quickest way to have a complete, functional application
- Once frontend is deployed, you'll have a full end-to-end working system
